# DIPD Package
[//]: <> TODO add some banners here like tests passing, version, coverage etc.

**The DIP Decomposition** is a loss-based global feature attribution technique, that explains how much each feature contributes to the predictive performance.
In contrast to standard feature attribution techniques it separates the standalone contributions of the individual features and cooperative contributions stemming from interactions and dependencies between features.

The DIP decomposition was introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23772).
